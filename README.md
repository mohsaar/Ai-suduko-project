Sudoku Solver using AI (DFS & Backtracking)
This project is a simple Sudoku solver that uses Depth-First Search (DFS) combined with Backtracking to find a valid solution for any given Sudoku puzzle.

Algorithms Used:
Depth-First Search (DFS):
Searches possible number placements deeply.

Backtracking:
Reverts decisions when a dead end is reached to explore other possibilities.

Features:
Automatically solves any valid Sudoku puzzle.

Efficient and fast due to smart backtracking.

Easy to integrate with a user interface for visualization.
